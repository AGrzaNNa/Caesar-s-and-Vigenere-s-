Encryption Project
  This project implements basic encryption and decryption algorithms, namely the Caesar cipher and the Vigenère cipher, in Python. It also includes functionalities for automated decryption and breaking the Vigenère cipher.

Features
  Caesar Cipher: Encodes and decodes text using a fixed shift.
  Vigenère Cipher: Encrypts and decrypts text using a keyword.
  Automated Decryption: Can automatically decrypt Caesar cipher text.
  Vigenère Cipher Breaker: Attempts to break Vigenère cipher using known keyword length.

File Structure
  caesar_cipher.py: Contains functions related to the Caesar cipher.
  vigenere_cipher.py: Contains functions related to the Vigenère cipher.
  helper_functions.py: Includes helper functions used across the project.
  main.py: Main program to interact with the encryption and decryption functionalities.

Usage
  Run main.py to access the main menu.
  Choose the encryption or decryption option you want to use.
  Follow the prompts to input text and keys as required.
  View the results displayed on the console.

Testing
  The project includes unit tests to ensure the correctness of encryption and decryption operations.
  Run python -m unittest to execute the test suite.

Dependencies
  The project uses the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for word validation.
